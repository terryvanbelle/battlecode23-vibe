Append-only record of the project, one entry per step or attempt. Corrections are dated entries in place, never edits
of history. Times are PDT. Grep it; do not read it whole.

## 2026-10-07 07:45 — Start (PROMPTS 1-5)

- Repo `terryvanbelle/battlecode23-vibe` created. Prior-year repos are all present locally and up to date with GitHub
  (2020, 2024, 2025 working copies; 21, 22, 26 and anicolao/bcenv under `~/projects/vibe/reference/`). Cross-year advice
  `terryvanbelle/battlecode-vibe` cloned (branch `main` holds ADVICE.md plus the five topic guides COMBAT, ECONOMY,
  EXPLORATION, NAVIGATION, SYMMETRY).
- **Disclosure: brief exposure to 2023-tagged lines.** While locating how the topic guides tag their sources, a `grep
  2023` printed about 60 lines tagged with 2023 sources (fragments of 2023 post-mortem advice on kiting, carrier cargo
  throws, comms layouts, bug navigation and type ratios) before any filter existed. Nothing was read beyond that grep
  output. From then on, every prior-year document is read only through the filtered reading room
  (`~/projects/vibe/reference/readroom-no2023/`, built by `reference/battlecode-vibe-no2023/build_readroom.py`, which
  drops every block tagged 2023 or naming a 2023 team or unit; residual matches 0 over 2,057 files). ADVICE.md itself
  has no 2023-tagged lines.
- Owner prompt 3: 2024 local storage may be cleared. Removed the pushed 2024 repo's untracked build products
  (build, diag, engine, gauntlet, matches, tools/.venv), `bc24-benchmarks/`, `bc24-classify.tsv`, and the 2024 engine
  clones. Driver free disk 1.9 GB -> 2.9 GB.
- Engine: the official public jar `battlecode23-3.0.15.jar` (fat jar, all dependencies and 103 maps) downloads from
  releases.battlecode.org (3.0.14, the version the official runner used, is not downloadable). The cloned source
  `battlecode/battlecode23` master is exactly tag 3.0.15. `tools/get-engine.sh` pins the checksum and compiles one patched
  class (LiveMap.getSeed honours `-Dbc.game.seed`), since the engine otherwise seeds robot ids and every sandboxed Random
  from the map file, so (bots, map, side) would fully determine a game.
- First game (driver): examplefuncsplayer mirror on maptestsmall ran 2000 rounds in 2 min 41 s, won by A on the mana
  tiebreak.
- VM `battlecode-dev` (us-west1-b, 8 vCPU / 31 GB / 20 GB disk, 8.6 GB free) started; it is in the driver's zone and is
  reached on its internal IP. `battlecode-dev2` (2024's, us-west2-a) is left untouched.
- Throughput (examplefuncsplayer mirror, DefaultMap, 2000 rounds): K=1 52.7 s/game; K=4 3.7 games/min; K=8 8.9
  games/min; K=12 9.7 games/min. About 3 MB per replay.
- GitHub code search (REST `search/code`) returns HTTP 500 for every query today; discovery uses repository search,
  push/creation-date windows and the forks of `battlecode/battlecode23-scaffold` instead (864 candidates).

## 2026-10-07 08:00-13:00 — Phase 0 instruments, reading, field

- Reading (workflow, 26 agents): per-slice reports for bc22/26/25/21/20/24, bcenv, the basics guides mapped to 2023,
  galaxy; synthesis and gap reads in `research/prior/`. Rules digest (workflow, 13 agents, adversarially verified):
  `RULES.md` + `research/rules/`. TRAINING_ALGORITHM.md written (year-agnostic).
- Field (BENCHMARK.md): 864 repo-search candidates + 22 from a web sweep; 148 repos use the 2023 API; 18 excluded
  (engine and its forks, non-entrants); 968 packages compiled; 87 entrants after two selection rules and hash dedupe.
- Replay reader `tools/replay-dump.sh` (.bc23): rebuilt state from events; fixture tests pin numbers cross-checked
  against the raw stream and the engine's verdict.

## 2026-10-07 13:00-15:00 — Foundation bot g_iter0

- Draft bot vs examplefuncsplayer, 8 maps x 2 sides: 16/16. Replay trace found (1) overruns on every unit's first turn
  (map memory alloc + full scan): fixed by a bytecode-budgeted end-of-turn fill; (2) carriers mined 0 mana (wells seen
  out of write range were never shared): fixed by late reporting and role adaptation; (3) Ad floating.
- Exceptions 1-7 per game: a robot that moved since turn start wrote the shared array outside its write zone. Every write
  now re-checks legality (`Comms.put`). 0 since.
- foundation1/2 (all 103 maps x 2 sides): 206/206. Basics: 0 overruns, 0 exceptions; symmetry wrong on Sine (HQ evidence
  used at round 1 before every HQ had registered; fixed: no HQ evidence before round 2); 12 games never decided
  (ambiguous maps; fixed: candidates that predict the same enemy HQs count as decided).
- Anchor degeneracy (Forest trace): 89 anchors built, 85 taken, 4 placed; carriers hoarded unplaceable anchors all game.
  Fix: safe-side targets, free-tile approach, timeout and return, per-HQ anchor period, predicted islands by symmetry.
  foundation3: 206/206; basics PASS (0/0/0, symmetry never wrong, decided by r150 in 204/206, never-decided 0); anchors
  placed 51% of built (36% before); r2000 games 9 (18 before); Mn collected +3.6 SE.
- Snapshot **g_iter0** (code hash e6f2fc5356c6).

## 2026-10-07 15:00 — First field calibration (174 games, 2 per entrant, random maps/sides/seeds)

- g_iter0: 131-43 (75.3%); BT 1732 +- 66, rank 17 of 88; field score 75.0%; 16 entrants beat us 2-0.
- Loss census (43 games, medians, us vs them): carriers built 21 vs 78; launchers 58 vs 141; Mn collected 602 vs 6,492;
  Ad 442 vs 2,559; kills 29 vs 82; anchors placed 1 vs 4. Wins: collected Mn 1,245 vs 85.
- Trace (awesomelemonade.finalBot, ReverseFunnel): equal collection to r250; our carriers flatlined at 16 (cap) while
  theirs reached 50; Ad floated 1,000-1,900 from r300; our launchers stuck below the dividing wall r120-r250 (bug
  navigation flipped hand every 24 moves along a long wall). Strong bots mine mostly mana (camel_case on Risk: 1,700 Mn,
  27 Ad; awesomelemonade on ReverseFunnel: 12,186 Mn, 4,521 Ad); none upgraded wells.

## 2026-10-07 15:00-15:30 — Instruments: identity control, paired cells

- Identity control: the working bot (byte-identical to g_iter0) on 30 calibration cells: 30/30 identical results and
  identical island-rounds margins. Games are deterministic against external bots given (opponent, map, side, seed).
- A second "identity" run was not one: it compiled src/bot after the next change had been synced. Runs now record the
  code hash of the bot that played (`provenance.txt`).

## 2026-10-07 15:30 — Arm c_econ1: carrier production bounded by live robots per known well

- Pre-registered: the old cap counted carriers EVER built per HQ (4 + round/40, max 24), a lockout under attrition.
  Counter: carriers built in losses. Gate: paired on the 174 calibration cells vs g_iter0.
- Result: carriers built in losses 21 -> 34, Mn 602 -> 799, Ad 442 -> 813, Ad float at end 1,340 -> 880; outcomes
  identical 164, gained 7, lost 3: net +4 (+1.26 SE, sign p 0.34); island-rounds margin -9.7 (t -0.14). Neutral.
  Kept in the working line (a cap removal; it is the base for the next arms), not snapshotted as an accept.

## 2026-10-07 15:30 — Queued arms (each paired on the 174 calibration cells against its predecessor)

- c_nav1 (on c_econ1): bug navigation keeps its hand for the whole obstacle; flips only at the map edge or after
  2(W+H) moves; refuses steps onto currents that push straight back; waits for robots on the wall path. Counters wh/bf.
- c_mana1 (on c_nav1): mana-first carrier roles (adamantium only while the delivering HQ holds < 120 Ad; the first 40
  rounds alternate).
- diag-top4: the working bot vs awesomelemonade, camel_case, CyrilSharma, NotLLeon on DefaultMap/Maze/Forest, both
  sides, all replays kept, census with carrier state tokens and launcher micro rates.

## 2026-10-07 15:45 — Ladder replica live; tactics of the top four (diag-top4, g_iter0 code)

- The ladder replica started for real (87 field bots, `us:examplefuncsplayer`, `us:g_iter0`; one autoscrim round to
  seed ratings, then the matchmaker). Site and access: `ACCESS.md`.
- Profile (`tools/profile.py`, 24 games, means; alive counts at r100 and r250, collected by r100 and r250):

  | team | C100 | L100 | Mn100 | Ad100 | C250 | L250 | Mn250 | first anchor | exposed | dmg/contact |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
  | us | 22 | 10 | 296 | 449 | 21 | 8 | 913 | 118 | 0.168 | 13 |
  | CyrilSharma.finalBot | 18 | 18 | 682 | 86 | 30 | 46 | 2,450 | 276 | 0.002 | 5.7 |
  | awesomelemonade.finalBot | 18 | 17 | 653 | 177 | 30 | 50 | 2,322 | 314 | 0.005 | 2.4 |
  | jmerle.camel_case_v30_final | 18 | 17 | 760 | 59 | 30 | 53 | 2,460 | 349 | | |
  | NotLLeon.v7 | 14 | 14 | 478 | 7 | 20 | 20 | 1,392 | 196 | 0.137 | 9.2 |

- Timeline (awesomelemonade on DefaultMap, 3 HQs each, both teams start with 600 Ad + 600 Mn): by r20 they field 13
  launchers to our 6 and have killed 6 of ours for 3; they spent the whole starting mana on launchers and their
  carriers delivered 107 Mn by r20 (ours 56). Our launchers die by r140 (0 alive), our carriers by r180; the rest of the
  game is their island count climbing to 75%.
- Reading: total collection is equal to r100 (745 vs ~770); the split and the launcher count decide the game, and the
  early launcher fights are lost in numbers and exposure. The queued arms (mana-first roles; pinned-enemy micro and
  safe step-in; launcher batches) target exactly these. Their first anchor comes at r200-350, after map control.

## 2026-10-07 15:50 — Arm c_nav1: neutral, negative signature; c_nav2 queued

- c_nav1 vs c_econ1, 174 calibration cells: identical 164, gained 5, lost 5 (net 0); island-rounds margin -70 (t -0.58).
- Delivery: oscillation fell (aba -50 per game, t -2.8) but robots stood still more (launchers +3.1 points of their
  rounds, t +6.1; carriers +5.1, t +7.7), collection fell ~7% (Mn -125, t -1.67; Ad -126, t -1.68) and games ran 30
  rounds longer. Not accepted as is.
- Likeliest cause: the new 3-turn wait for a robot on the wall-following path (carriers crowd wells and the HQ).
  c_nav2 = c_nav1 without it, paired on the same cells against c_nav1 (queued). The working line drops the wait too.
- Arms built on c_nav1 (mana1, mana2, micro1, batch1, spawn1, army1) keep their paired comparisons against their own
  predecessors; the combined candidate will carry c_nav2's navigation if it holds.

## 2026-10-07 16:15 — Correctness audit (engine API; shared state) -> arm c_audit1

- Two read-only auditors on src/bot. Clean: every action guarded by its can* check, no reachable
  GameActionException, every write re-checked, encodings and symmetry images correct, costs and radii match RULES.
- Defects found and fixed (c_audit1 = c_spawn1 + c_nav2's navigation + these):
  - carriers moved once a turn when empty or light although the engine allows two (move cooldown 5 + 0.375 w < 10
    up to 13 kg): every outbound trip, well search and flight ran at half speed;
  - carriers mined only wells in the 16 shared slots, so a well a carrier saw out of write range waited for a
    delivery to be registered (62 of 103 maps have no mana well in HQ vision);
  - island slots have no timestamp and robots republished 60-round-old owners over newer news; HQs built anchors for
    enemy-held islands no carrier could place; launchers trusted a stale "enemy" owner over their own sighting and
    all walked to one stored tile of an enemy island (anchor decay scales with robots on its squares);
  - enemy sightings: the 4-bit round stamp wrapped after 256 rounds (old sightings looked fresh); clears reached
    beyond the launcher's vision;
  - the shared symmetry mask could eliminate all three; predicted anchor islands were never resolved;
  - launcher fight() cost ~47 + 8P bytecodes per enemy per tile (~12k in a 10-fighter fight, limit 10k): now
    per-enemy data once and a bytecode guard; "pinned" no longer counts current pushes.
- Gate: c_audit1 on the 174 calibration cells, paired against g_iter0's own calibration run (the cumulative line
  since the incumbent), moved to the front of the queue.

## 2026-10-07 16:30 — Arm c_mana1 rejected (the mechanism ran backwards)

- c_mana1 vs c_nav1, 174 calibration cells: identical 163, gained 2, lost 9 (net -7, -2.11 SE, sign p 0.065).
- Delivery inverted: mana collected -294 (t -4.5), adamantium +229 (t +3.3), mana by r250 -112 (t -6.7), launchers
  alive at r250 -1.7 (t -5.8), launchers built -4.2. The adaptive rule (adamantium while the HQ holds < 120 Ad) read
  "short" nearly always, because the HQ spends Ad on carriers as soon as it has it.
- The working line keeps c_nav1's policy (switch C.ROLES = 0); c_mana2 (1 in 5 on Ad, overrides only on real
  surplus/shortage) is still queued and decides whether ROLES becomes 2. Every arm queued after c_mana1 (micro1,
  batch1, spawn1, army1, audit1) carries c_mana1's roles: their comparisons against their own predecessors stand,
  but their absolute levels are depressed.

## 2026-10-07 16:50 — The line since g_iter0 (c_audit1) loses to g_iter0; HQ overruns found

- c_audit1 (econ1 + nav1 + mana1 + micro1 + batch1 + spawn1 + audit fixes) vs g_iter0's calibration run, same 174
  cells: identical 162, gained 3, lost 9 (net -6, -1.73 SE, sign p 0.15); island-rounds margin -259 (t -1.96).
- The economy tilted to adamantium: Ad collected +894 (t +8.3), carriers built +19 (t +10.3) and lost +6.9, Mn
  -107, launchers built -6.7 (t -3.4), anchors placed -0.2. Causes on record: c_mana1's roles (rejected), and a
  carrier bound (live robots, 30 + 15 per well) that no longer limits anything while carriers are built 1:1 with
  launchers.
- Basics regression: 111 HQ bytecode overruns in 10 of 174 games, all sieges we lost (HQ max 20,005-20,019 of
  20,000). Cause: spawn safety scored every spawn tile against every visible enemy for every build (up to 6 a turn).
  Fixed in the working line: threat per spawn tile once per turn, and the build loop stops below 4,000 bytecodes
  left. To be confirmed on replica games (siege cells are against field bots).
- Not accepted. The working line now: c_nav1's carrier roles (C.ROLES = 0), c_nav2's navigation, audit fixes, the
  HQ fix. Next evaluations go through the galaxy replica (PROMPTS 11).

## 2026-10-07 17:15 — Arm c_mana2 kept (roles)

- c_mana2 vs c_nav1, 174 calibration cells: identical 159, gained 10, lost 5 (net +5, +1.29 SE, sign p 0.30);
  island-rounds margin -40 (t -0.49).
- Delivered as designed: Mn by r100 +62 (t +8.9), Ad by r100 -112, launchers alive r100 +0.85 (t +5.3) and r250
  +1.3 (t +3.3), carriers built -7.3 and lost -2.2. Game-long Mn slightly lower (-78, t -1.1: fewer carriers).
- Working line: C.ROLES = 2.

## 2026-10-07 18:05 — Arm c_micro1 failed delivery (diag-top4)

- c_micro1 vs c_mana1, 24 games against four top bots: exposure +0.029 (t +1.75; bar: down), damage per contact
  +0.8, kills -5.3 (t -2.3), launchers alive r100 -1.7 (t -2.2); outcomes 1-2 net -1. The mechanism fired (pinned
  enemies seen in 24/24 games, mean 124; unsafe steps avoided mean 28) but moved the signature the wrong way.
- Working line: switch C.MICRO = false restores g_iter0's fight scoring (with the audit's bytecode-safe structure).
- Candidate for the replica panel: c_line3 = working line (mana2 roles, nav2, audit fixes, HQ fix, spawn safety,
  launcher batches, MICRO off, ARMY off). c_line2 (micro on) was never run and is removed.
