# TRAINING_LOG.md

Append-only record of the project, one entry per step or attempt. Corrections are dated entries in place, never edits
of history. Times are PDT. Grep it; do not read it whole.

- Repo `terryvanbelle/battlecode23-vibe` created. Prior-year repos are all present locally and up to date with GitHub
  (2020, 2024, 2025 working copies; 21, 22, 26 and anicolao/bcenv under `~/projects/vibe/reference/`). Cross-year advice
  `terryvanbelle/battlecode-vibe` cloned (branch `main` holds ADVICE.md plus the five topic guides COMBAT, ECONOMY,
  EXPLORATION, NAVIGATION, SYMMETRY).
- **Disclosure: brief exposure to 2023-tagged lines.** While locating how the topic guides tag their sources, a `grep
  2023` printed about 60 lines tagged with 2023 sources (fragments of 2023 post-mortem advice on kiting, carrier cargo
  throws, comms layouts, bug navigation and type ratios) before any filter existed. Nothing was read beyond that grep
  output. From then on, every prior-year document is read only through the filtered reading room
  (`~/projects/vibe/reference/readroom-no2023/`, built by `reference/battlecode-vibe-no2023/build_readroom.py`, which
  drops every block tagged 2023 or naming a 2023 team or unit; residual matches 0 over 2,057 files). ADVICE.md itself
  has no 2023-tagged lines.
- Owner prompt 3: 2024 local storage may be cleared. Removed the pushed 2024 repo's untracked build products
  (build, diag, engine, gauntlet, matches, tools/.venv), `bc24-benchmarks/`, `bc24-classify.tsv`, and the 2024 engine
  clones. Driver free disk 1.9 GB -> 2.9 GB.
- Engine: the official public jar `battlecode23-3.0.15.jar` (fat jar, all dependencies and 103 maps) downloads from
  releases.battlecode.org (3.0.14, the version the official runner used, is not downloadable). The cloned source
  `battlecode/battlecode23` master is exactly tag 3.0.15. `tools/get-engine.sh` pins the checksum and compiles one patched
  class (LiveMap.getSeed honours `-Dbc.game.seed`), since the engine otherwise seeds robot ids and every sandboxed Random
  from the map file, so (bots, map, side) would fully determine a game.
- First game (driver): examplefuncsplayer mirror on maptestsmall ran 2000 rounds in 2 min 41 s, won by A on the mana
  tiebreak.
- VM `battlecode-dev` (us-west1-b, 8 vCPU / 31 GB / 20 GB disk, 8.6 GB free) started; it is in the driver's zone and is
  reached on its internal IP. `battlecode-dev2` (2024's, us-west2-a) is left untouched.
- Throughput (examplefuncsplayer mirror, DefaultMap, 2000 rounds): K=1 52.7 s/game; K=4 3.7 games/min; K=8 8.9
  games/min; K=12 9.7 games/min. About 3 MB per replay.
- GitHub code search (REST `search/code`) returns HTTP 500 for every query today; discovery uses repository search,
  push/creation-date windows and the forks of `battlecode/battlecode23-scaffold` instead (864 candidates).
